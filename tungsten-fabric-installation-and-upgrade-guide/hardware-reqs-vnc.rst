Server Requirements and Supported Platforms
===========================================

:date: 2020-08-17

This topic discusses server requirements in a Tungsten Fabric
cluster.

Each server must have a minimum of:

-  64 GB memory.

-  300 GB hard drive.

-  4 CPU cores.

-  At least one Ethernet port.

A server can either be a physical device or a virtual machine. For
scalability and availability reasons, it is highly recommended to use
physical servers in most use cases whenever possible.

Server role assignments vary by environment. All non-compute roles can
be configured in each controller node if desired in your topology.

All installation images are available in repositories.

The Tungsten Fabric image includes the following software:

-  All dependent software packages needed to support installation and
   operation of OpenStack and TF.

-  Tungsten Fabric Controller software – all components.

-  OpenStack release currently in use for TF.

All components required for installing the Tungsten Fabric Controller are
available for each TF release, for the supported Linux operating
systems and versions, and for the supported versions of OpenStack.

For a list of supported platforms for all Tungsten Fabric releases,

Configuring Graceful Restart and Long-lived Graceful Restart
============================================================

Graceful restart and long-lived graceful restart BGP helper modes are
supported for the TF control node and XMPP helper mode.

Application of Graceful Restart and Long-lived Graceful Restart
---------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever a BGP peer session is detected as down, all routes learned from
the peer are deleted and immediately withdrawn from advertised peers.
This causes instantaneous disruption to traffic flowing end-to-end, even
when routes kept in the vrouter kernel in the data plane remain intact.

Graceful restart and long-lived graceful restart features can be used to
alleviate traffic disruption caused by downs.

When configured, graceful restart features enable existing network
traffic to be unaffected if TF controller processes go down. The
TF implementation ensures that if a TF control module
restarts, it can use graceful restart functionality provided by its BGP
peers. Or when the BGP peers restart, TF provides a graceful
restart helper mode to minimize the impact to the network. The graceful
restart features can be used to ensure that traffic is not affected by
temporary outage of processes.

Graceful restart is not enabled by default.

With graceful restart features enabled, learned routes are not deleted
when sessions go down, and the routes are not withdrawn from the
advertised peers. Instead, the routes are kept and marked as 'stale'.
Consequently, if sessions come back up and routes are relearned, the
overall impact to the network is minimized.

After a certain duration, if a downed session does not come back up, all
remaining stale routes are deleted and withdrawn from advertised peers.

The graceful restart and long-lived graceful restart features can be
enabled only for BGP peers in TF 3.2.

BGP Graceful Restart Helper Mode
--------------------------------

The BGP helper mode can be used to minimize routing churn whenever a BGP
session flaps. This is especially helpful if the SDN gateway router goes
down gracefully, as in an rpd crash or restart on an MX Series Junos
device. In that case, the contrail-control can act as a graceful restart
helper to the gateway, by retaining the routes learned from the gateway
and advertising them to the rest of the network as applicable. In order
for this to work, the restarting router (the SDN gateway in this case)
must support and be configured with graceful restart for all of the
address families used.

The graceful restart helper mode is also supported for BGP-as-a-Service
(BGPaaS) clients. When configured, contrail-control can provide a
graceful restart or long-lived graceful restart helper mode to a
restarting BGPaaS client.

Feature Highlights
------------------

The following are highlights of the graceful restart and long-lived
graceful restart features.

-  Configuring a non-zero restart time enables the ability to advertise
   graceful restart and long-lived graceful restart capabilities in BGP.

-  Configuring helper mode enables the ability for graceful restart and
   long-lived graceful restart helper modes to retain routes even after
   sessions go down.

-  With graceful restart configured, whenever a session down event is
   detected and a closing process is triggered, all routes, across all
   address families, are marked stale. The stale routes are eligible for
   best-path election for the configured graceful restart time duration.

-  When long-lived graceful restart is in effect, stale routes can be
   retained for a much longer time than that allowed by graceful restart
   alone. With long-lived graceful restart, route preference is retained
   and best paths are recomputed. The community marked LLGR_STALE is
   tagged for stale paths and re-advertised. However, if no long-lived
   graceful restart community is associated with any received stale
   route, those routes are not kept, instead, they are deleted.

-  After a certain time, if a session comes back up, any remaining stale
   routes are deleted. If the session does not come back up, all
   retained stale routes are permanently deleted and withdrawn from the
   advertised peer.

XMPP Helper Mode
----------------

TF supports for long-lived graceful restart (LLGR) with XMPP
helper mode. Graceful restart and long lived graceful restart can be
enabled using the Tungsten Fabric WebUI or by using the provision_control
script.

The helper modes can also be enabled via schema, and can be disabled
selectively in a contrail-control node for BGP or XMPP sessions by
configuring ``gr_helper_disable`` in the
``/etc/contrail/contrail-control.conf`` configuration file.

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

Graceful restart parameters are configured in the
``global-system-config`` of the schema. They can be configured by means
of a provisioning script or by using the Tungsten Fabric WebUI.

Configure a non-zero restart time to advertise for graceful restart and
long-lived graceful restart capabilities from peers.

Configure helper mode for graceful restart and long-lived graceful
restart to retain routes even after sessions go down.

Configuration parameters include:

-  ``enable`` or ``disable`` for all graceful restart parameters:

   -  ``restart-time``

   -  ``long-lived-restart-time``

   -  ``end-of-rib-timeout``

-  ``bgp-helper-enable`` to enable graceful restart helper mode for BGP
   peers in contrail-control

-  ``xmpp-helper-enable`` to enable graceful restart helper mode for
   XMPP peers (agents) in contrail-control

The following shows configuration by a provision script.

::

   /opt/contrail/utils/provision_control.py 
               --api_server_ip 10.xx.xx.20 
               --api_server_port 8082 
               --router_asn 64512             
               --admin_user admin
               --admin_password <password> 
               --admin_tenant_name admin 
               --set_graceful_restart_parameters 
               --graceful_restart_time 60 
               --long_lived_graceful_restart_time 300 
               --end_of_rib_timeout 30 
               --graceful_restart_enable 
               --graceful_restart_bgp_helper_enable

The following are sample parameters:

::

   -set_graceful_restart_parameters 
               --graceful_restart_time 300 
               --long_lived_graceful_restart_time 60000 
               --end_of_rib_timeout 30 
               --graceful_restart_enable 
               --graceful_restart_bgp_helper_enable 

When BGP peering with Juniper Networks devices, Junos must also be
explicitly configured for graceful restart/long-lived graceful restart,
as shown in the following example:

::

   set routing-options graceful-restart
   set protocols bgp group <a1234> type internal
   set protocols bgp group <a1234> local-address 10.xx.xxx.181
   set protocols bgp group <a1234> keep all
   set protocols bgp group <a1234> family inet-vpn unicast graceful-restart long-lived restarter stale-time 20
   set protocols bgp group <a1234> family route-target graceful-restart long-lived restarter stale-time 20
   set protocols bgp group <a1234> graceful-restart restart-time 600
   set protocols bgp group <a1234> neighbor 10.xx.xx.20 peer-as 64512

The graceful restart helper modes can be enabled in the schema. The
helper modes can be disabled selectively in the
``contrail-control.conf`` for BGP sessions by configuring
``gr_helper_disable`` in the
``/etc/contrail/contrail-control.conf``\ file.

The following are examples:

``/usr/bin/openstack-config /etc/contrail/contrail-control.conf DEFAULT gr_helper_bgp_disable 1``

``/usr/bin/openstack-config /etc/contrail/contrail-control.conf DEFAULT gr_helper_xmpp_disable 1``

``service contrail-control restart``

Cautions for Graceful Restart
-----------------------------

Be aware of the following caveats when configuring and using graceful
restart.

-  Using the graceful restart/long-lived graceful restart feature with a
   peer is effective either to all negotiated address families or to
   none. If a peer signals support for graceful restart/long-lived
   graceful restart for only a subset of the negotiated address
   families, the graceful restart helper mode does not come into effect
   for any family in the set of negotiated address families.

-  Because graceful restart is not yet supported for
   contrail-vrouter-agent, the parameter should *not* be set for
   ``graceful_restart_xmpp_helper_enable``. If the vrouter agent
   restarts, the data plane is reset and the routes and flows are
   reprogrammed anew, which typically results in traffic loss for
   several seconds for new and /existing flows.

-  Graceful restart/long-lived graceful restart is not supported for
   multicast routes.

-  Graceful restart/long-lived graceful restart helper mode may not work
   correctly for EVPN routes, if the restarting node does not preserve
   forwarding state for EVPN routes.

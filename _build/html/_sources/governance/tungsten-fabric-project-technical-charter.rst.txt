====================================================

Adopted March 13, 2018

This charter (the “Charter”) sets forth the responsibilities and
procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the Tungsten
Fabric Project, which has been established as Tungsten Fabric Project a
Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”). LF Projects, LLC (“LF
Projects”) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All
Contributors to the Project must comply with the terms of this Charter.

1) **Mission and Scope of the Project**

   a. The Tungsten Fabric Project is an open source project that is
      built using standards-based protocols and provides all the
      necessary components for network virtualization and network
      security. The components of the Project include: an SDN
      controller, virtual router, analytics engine, published northbound
      APIs, hardware integration features, cloud orchestration software
      and an extensive REST API.

   b. The mission of the Project is to facilitate the development,
      evolution and adoption of the Tungsten Fabric Project codebase to
      enable a comprehensive network and security fabric that
      encompasses various open source ecosystems, including virtual
      machine-based public and private clouds, container-based clouds
      and ecosystems and other computational platforms. The community’s
      goal is to maintain and improve the production-ready and scalable
      nature of the Project while accelerating development and
      attracting additional developers and users to the platform.

   c. The scope of the Project includes development of the Tungsten
      Fabric code base under an OSI-approved open source license
      supporting the mission, including documentation, testing,
      integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the
      development, deployment, operation or adoption of the Project.

   b. The TSC voting members are initially selected from the Project’s
      Committers and Community volunteers. The TSC voting members, TSC
      election process and TSC defined processes and procedures will be
      documented in the TSC section of the community documentation
      repository. TSC will initially have 11 voting members, but may
      modify the number of voting members by two-thirds vote of all TSC
      members.

   c. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to
      be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via
      teleconference, or in person.

   d. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers.
      The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are
      documented in the TSC section of the community documentation
      repository. Unless otherwise documented:

      i.   Contributors include anyone in the technical community that
             contributes code, documentation, or other technical
             artifacts to the Project;

      ii.  Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to
             modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other
             technical artifacts in a project’s repository;

      iii. The primary distinguishing characteristic of Committers is
             a demonstrated history of performing code reviews in the
             project code review system. References to quantity and/or
             quality of code reviews (of other Contributors’ code, not
             the Committer’s own code) should be given predominant
             weight when voting on the addition or removal of a
             Committer;

      iv.   A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval
             of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a
             majority approval of the other existing Committers; and

      v.    A Committer may be elected by other sub-project Committers
             to serve as a Project Technical Lead (PTL) and provide
             direction for a sub-project. The TSC may cast a tiebreaking
             vote or appoint a PTL in the absence of a majority
             agreement of the Committers.

   e. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and
      Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of
      this Charter.

   f. The TSC may (1) establish workflow procedures for the submission,
      approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements
      for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as
      applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the
      roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and
      publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

   g. The TSC will elect a TSC Chair, annually, who will preside over
      meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or
      replacement by the TSC. The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so
      designated by the TSC, will serve as the primary communication
      contact between the Project and LFN.

3) **TSC Voting**

   a. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus based community,
      if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward,
      the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting
      member basis.

   b. TSC votes must be conducted electronically, even if initiated
      verbally at a meeting, and, except as provided in Sections 2.b.,
      7.c. and 8.a., decisions will require the majority of all voting
      members of the TSC.

   c. TSC will define and document an appropriate conflict resolution
      mechanism, subject to approval by the Series Manager. This
      mechanism will be used in the event a vote cannot be resolved by
      the TSC.

   a. This Charter is subject to the Series Agreement for the Project
      and the Operating Agreement of LF Projects. Contributors will
      comply with the policies of LF Projects as may be adopted and
      amended by LF Projects, including, without limitation the policies
      listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies/.

   b. The TSC may adopt a code of conduct (“CoC”) for the Project, which
      is subject to approval by the Series Manager. Contributors to the
      Project will comply with the CoC or, in the event that a
      Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Projects Code
      of Conduct listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies/.

   d. All participants must allow open participation from any individual
      or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under
      this Charter and any policies adopted for all participants by the
      TSC, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the
      Project community must not seek to exclude any participant based
      on any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are
      reasonable and applied on a non- discriminatory basis to all
      participants. Contribution requirements will be set based on
      reasonable criteria and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to
      all participants in the Project community.

   e. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative,
      and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project

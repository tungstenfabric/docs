   TF TSC Voters and Candidates Diagram

The basic groups in the TF community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Community At Large**: All TF users and contributors.
-  **Active Technical Contributors (ATC)**: People who have had a patch
   merged within the past 12 months. Defined in `Sections 3.2 and
   5.2.3.2.3`_ of the Community Governance document.
-  **Technical Steering Committee Approved Active Technical Contributors
   (TSC-ATC)**: People who have made technical contributions
   (participated in architectural discussions, for instance), but who
   have not had a patch merged. Defined in `Section 5.2.4.2.1`_ of the
   Community Governance document.
-  **Active Community Contributors (ACC)**: People who have made
   non-technical contributions that further the mission of TF. Defined
   in `Section 5.2.4.2.3`_ of the Community Governance document.

Groups directly involved in TF governance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Technical Project Leadership**: ATC + TSC-ATC.
-  **Technical Committee (TC)**: An elected standing committee of TF
   composed of 5 people elected out of the Technical Project Leadership.
   These people also are members of the Technical Steering Committee
   (TSC; see below). Defined in `Section 5.2.2`_ of the Community
   Governance document.
-  **Community Committee (CC)**: An elected standing committee of TF
   composed of 5 people elected out of the Community At Large. These
   people also are members of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC; see
   below). Defined in `Section 5.2.2`_ of the Community Governance
   document.
-  **Architecture Review Board (ARB)**: A nominated and TSC-confirmed
   standing committee of TF composed of 7 people from the Community At
   Large. Defined in `Section 5.2.2`_ of the Community Governance
   document.
-  **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**: Overall leadership for the TF
   project. Composed of the entirety of the TC and CC plus one member of
   the ARB. Defined further in `Section 2`_ of the Technical Charter and
   `Section 5`_ of the Community Governance document.

Other roles
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Project Technical Lead (PTL)**: The leader and spokesperson for a
   sub-project of TF. This is an elected position. The PTL for a project
   is likely to be on the TSC or the ARB, but this is not a requirement
   of the position.
-  **Voting community member**: In order to vote in TF elections, a
   person must be in the ATC, TSC-ATC, or ACC, which is to say, they
   must be recognised as a contributing member of the community. This is
   defined in `Section 5.2.4.3`_ of the Community Governance document.

Community Commitments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The items below describe the commitments we ask of various community members.
Moving forward, our plan is to measure performance against these commitments
to help us ensure we are meeting our obligations to the Tungsten Fabric
community.

-  **Time to First Commit Review**: 2 weeks. Commits shall have an initial
   review within 2 weeks time.
-  **Time to First BluePrint Review**: 1 week.
-  **Minimum Time Between Submission of Blueprint and Code Merging**: 2 weeks
   (assuming no changes are required).
-  **Code Reviewer Diversity**: 2 developers. No '+2s' in Gerrit except for
   emergencies that are escalated to the TSC in the weekly calls.
-  **Community Working Group Meeting Attendance**: 80% participation per
   quarter. This applies to the docs project, marketing working
   group, Technical Workstream calls for technical community members, and TSC
   calls for TSC members, PTLs, and ARB members. Working group members must
   attend 80% of calls per quarter directly or via proxy. Community members who
   do not meet this commitment risk being removed from the group and having
   your company/manager notified of non-compliance. Attendance shall be
   measured manually by reviewing meeting notes for the quarter. Attendance
   shall be tracked using the Tungsten Fabric wiki. PTLs, working group chairs,
   and the TSC chair are responsible for enforcing attendance for their
   respective meetings.

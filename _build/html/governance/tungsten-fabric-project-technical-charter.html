<p>Adopted March 13, 2018</p>
<p>This charter (the “Charter”) sets forth the responsibilities and
procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the Tungsten
Fabric Project, which has been established as Tungsten Fabric Project a
Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”). LF Projects, LLC (“LF
Projects”) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All
Contributors to the Project must comply with the terms of this Charter.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Mission and Scope of the Project</strong></p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>The Tungsten Fabric Project is an open source project that is
built using standards-based protocols and provides all the
necessary components for network virtualization and network
security. The components of the Project include: an SDN
controller, virtual router, analytics engine, published northbound
APIs, hardware integration features, cloud orchestration software
and an extensive REST API.</p></li>
<li><p>The mission of the Project is to facilitate the development,
evolution and adoption of the Tungsten Fabric Project codebase to
enable a comprehensive network and security fabric that
encompasses various open source ecosystems, including virtual
machine-based public and private clouds, container-based clouds
and ecosystems and other computational platforms. The community’s
goal is to maintain and improve the production-ready and scalable
nature of the Project while accelerating development and
attracting additional developers and users to the platform.</p></li>
<li><p>The scope of the Project includes development of the Tungsten
Fabric code base under an OSI-approved open source license
supporting the mission, including documentation, testing,
integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the
development, deployment, operation or adoption of the Project.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Technical Steering Committee</strong></p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">

</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The TSC voting members are initially selected from the Project’s
Committers and Community volunteers. The TSC voting members, TSC
election process and TSC defined processes and procedures will be
documented in the TSC section of the community documentation
repository. TSC will initially have 11 voting members, but may
modify the number of voting members by two-thirds vote of all TSC
members.</p></li>
<li><p>Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to
be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via
teleconference, or in person.</p></li>
<li><p>TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers.
The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are
documented in the TSC section of the community documentation
repository. Unless otherwise documented:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Contributors include anyone in the technical community that</dt><dd><p>contributes code, documentation, or other technical
artifacts to the Project;</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to</dt><dd><p>modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other
technical artifacts in a project’s repository;</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>The primary distinguishing characteristic of Committers is</dt><dd><p>a demonstrated history of performing code reviews in the
project code review system. References to quantity and/or
quality of code reviews (of other Contributors’ code, not
the Committer’s own code) should be given predominant
weight when voting on the addition or removal of a
Committer;</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval</dt><dd><p>of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a
majority approval of the other existing Committers; and</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>A Committer may be elected by other sub-project Committers</dt><dd><p>to serve as a Project Technical Lead (PTL) and provide
direction for a sub-project. The TSC may cast a tiebreaking
vote or appoint a PTL in the absence of a majority
agreement of the Committers.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and
Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of
this Charter.</p></li>
<li><p>The TSC may (1) establish workflow procedures for the submission,
approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements
for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as
applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the
roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and
publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.</p></li>
<li><p>The TSC will elect a TSC Chair, annually, who will preside over
meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or
replacement by the TSC. The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so
designated by the TSC, will serve as the primary communication
contact between the Project and LFN.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>TSC Voting</strong></p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>While the Project aims to operate as a consensus based community,
if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward,
the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting
member basis.</p></li>
<li><p>TSC votes must be conducted electronically, even if initiated
verbally at a meeting, and, except as provided in Sections 2.b.,
7.c. and 8.a., decisions will require the majority of all voting
members of the TSC.</p></li>
<li><p>TSC will define and document an appropriate conflict resolution
mechanism, subject to approval by the Series Manager. This
mechanism will be used in the event a vote cannot be resolved by
the TSC.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Compliance with Policies</strong></p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>This Charter is subject to the Series Agreement for the Project

<li><p>The TSC may adopt a code of conduct (“CoC”) for the Project, which
is subject to approval by the Series Manager. Contributors to the
Project will comply with the CoC or, in the event that a
Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Projects Code
of Conduct listed at <a class="reference external" href="https://lfprojects.org/policies/">https://lfprojects.org/policies/</a>.</p></li>

provided, however, that in the case of any amendment of the
Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of LF Projects, any such
amendment is effective upon publication on LF Project’s web site.</p></li>
<li><p>All participants must allow open participation from any individual
or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under
this Charter and any policies adopted for all participants by the
TSC, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the
Project community must not seek to exclude any participant based
on any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are
reasonable and applied on a non- discriminatory basis to all
participants. Contribution requirements will be set based on
reasonable criteria and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to
all participants in the Project community.</p></li>

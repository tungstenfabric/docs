BGP helper modes are supported for the Contrail control node and XMPP
helper mode.</p></div></div><h2 id="jd0e13">Application of Graceful Restart and Long-lived Graceful Restart</h2><p>Whenever a BGP peer session is detected as down, all routes
learned from the peer are deleted and immediately withdrawn from advertised
peers. This causes instantaneous disruption to traffic flowing end-to-end,
even when routes kept in the vrouter kernel in the data plane remain
intact. </p><p>Graceful restart and long-lived graceful restart features can
be used to alleviate traffic disruption caused by downs.</p><p>When configured, graceful restart features enable existing network
traffic to be unaffected if Contrail controller processes go down.
The Contrail implementation ensures that if a Contrail control module
restarts, it can use graceful restart functionality provided by its
BGP peers. Or when the BGP peers restart, Contrail provides a graceful
restart helper mode to minimize the impact to the network. The graceful
restart features can be used  to ensure that traffic is not affected
by temporary outage of processes.</p><p>Graceful restart is not enabled by default.</p><p>With graceful restart features enabled, learned routes are not
deleted when sessions go down, and the routes are not withdrawn from
the advertised peers. Instead, the routes are kept and marked as 'stale'.
Consequently, if sessions come back up and routes are relearned, the
overall impact to the network is minimized.  </p><p>After a certain duration, if a downed session does not come
back up, all remaining stale routes are deleted and withdrawn from
advertised peers. </p><p>The graceful restart and long-lived graceful restart features
can be enabled only for BGP peers in Contrail 3.2.</p><h2 id="jd0e30">BGP Graceful Restart Helper Mode</h2><p>The BGP helper mode can be used to minimize routing churn whenever
a BGP session flaps. This is especially helpful if the SDN gateway
router goes down gracefully, as in an rpd crash or restart on an MX
Series Junos device. In that case, the contrail-control can act as
a graceful restart helper to the gateway, by retaining the routes
learned from the gateway and advertising them to the rest of the network
as applicable. In order for this to work, the restarting router (the
SDN gateway in this case) must support and be configured with graceful
restart for all of the address families used.</p><p>The graceful restart helper mode is also supported for BGP-as-a-Service
(BGPaaS) clients. When configured, contrail-control can provide a
graceful restart or long-lived graceful restart helper mode to a restarting
BGPaaS client.</p><h2 id="jd0e37">Feature Highlights</h2><p>The following are highlights of the graceful restart and long-lived
graceful restart features.</p><ul><li style=""><p>Configuring a non-zero restart time enables the ability
to advertise graceful restart and long-lived graceful restart capabilities
in BGP.</p></li><li style=""><p>Configuring helper mode enables the ability for graceful
restart and long-lived graceful restart helper modes to retain routes
even after sessions go down.</p></li><li style=""><p>With graceful restart configured, whenever a session down
event is detected and a closing process is triggered, all routes,
across all address families, are marked stale. The stale routes are
eligible for best-path election for the configured graceful restart
time duration. </p></li><li style=""><p> When long-lived graceful restart is in effect, stale
routes can be retained for a much longer time than that allowed by
graceful restart alone. With long-lived graceful restart, route preference
is retained and best paths are recomputed. The community marked LLGR_STALE
is tagged for stale paths and re-advertised. However, if no long-lived
graceful restart community is associated with any received stale route,
those routes are not kept, instead, they are deleted. </p></li><li style=""><p>After a certain time, if a session comes back up, any
remaining stale routes are deleted. If the session does not come back
up, all retained stale routes are permanently deleted and withdrawn
from the advertised peer.</p></li></ul><h2 id="jd0e58">XMPP Helper Mode</h2><p>Contrail supports for long-lived graceful restart (LLGR) with
XMPP helper mode. Graceful restart and long lived graceful restart
can be enabled using the Contrail web UI or by using the provision_control
script. </p><p>The helper modes can also be enabled via schema, and can be
disabled selectively in a contrail-control node for BGP or XMPP sessions
by configuring <code class="inline" v-pre="">gr_helper_disable</code> in the <code class="filepath">/etc/contrail/contrail-control.conf</code> configuration
file. </p><h2 id="jd0e71">Configuration Parameters </h2><p>Graceful restart parameters are configured in the <code class="inline" v-pre="">global-system-config</code> of the schema. They can be configured
by means of a provisioning script or by using the Contrail Web UI.</p><p>Configure a non-zero restart time to advertise for graceful
restart and long-lived graceful restart capabilities from peers. </p><p>Configure helper mode for graceful restart and long-lived graceful
restart to retain routes even after sessions go down. </p><p>Configuration parameters include:</p><ul><li style=""><p><code class="inline" v-pre="">enable</code> or <code class="inline" v-pre="">disable</code> for all graceful restart parameters:</p><ul><li style=""><p><code class="inline" v-pre="">restart-time</code></p></li><li style=""><p><code class="inline" v-pre="">long-lived-restart-time</code></p></li><li style=""><p><code class="inline" v-pre="">end-of-rib-timeout</code></p></li></ul></li><li style=""><p><code class="inline" v-pre="">bgp-helper-enable</code> to enable

graceful restart.</p><ul><li style=""><p>Using the graceful restart/long-lived graceful restart
feature with a peer is effective either to all negotiated address
families or to none. If a peer signals support for graceful restart/long-lived
graceful restart for only a subset of the negotiated address families,
the graceful restart helper mode does not come into effect for any
family in the set of negotiated address families. </p></li><li style=""><p>Because graceful restart is not yet supported for contrail-vrouter-agent,
the parameter should <em>not</em> be set for <code class="inline" v-pre="">graceful_restart_xmpp_helper_enable</code>. If the vrouter
agent restarts, the data plane is reset and the routes and flows are
reprogrammed anew, which typically results in traffic loss for several
seconds for new and /existing flows.</p></li><li style=""><p>Graceful restart/long-lived graceful restart is not supported
for multicast routes. </p></li><li style=""><p>Graceful restart/long-lived graceful restart helper mode
may not work correctly for EVPN routes, if the restarting node does
not preserve forwarding state for EVPN routes.</p></li></ul><h2 id="jd0e183">Configuring Graceful Restart using Contrail Command</h2><p>To configure graceful restart in Contrail Command, navigate
